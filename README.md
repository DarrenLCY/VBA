# VBA
Repo for sample VBA codes

This code was written when I was in the Internal Audit department 
at ABC Banking Corporation. My supervisor routinely assigned some
tasks to do, whereby I had to pull a large quantity of information
from an IT report (PDF file) and input them to Excel, which was very 
time-consuming. From my limited VBA experience, I saw that it was 
reasonable to automate this task by copying the whole data from the 
PDF file and pasting them into a blank Excel file, and then using 
VBA to extract the relevant data and classify them into the specific 
columns on another sheet (Worksheet "Results" in this case).
